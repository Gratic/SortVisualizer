# SortVisualizer

Simple project of visualizing sorting algorithms.
Made it on my free time. Absolutly not complete but it has a good shape for now.

## What sort are visualized
Currently Quicksort, Mergesort, Bubblesort.\n
I want to add more.\n

## What next ?
I want to add text under each sort to know its status and the sort being done.\n
I want to improve the overall design.\n
There is some stability issues, but I don't know from where there are coming, I don't really know how I should fix them.\n
Adding more sorts.\n
Adding more interactivity, like the numbers of elements getting sorted or the speed of sorting.\n

## SFML
Using SFML 2.5.1, when builded it should be static.
I used minGW and Clion for this project.
