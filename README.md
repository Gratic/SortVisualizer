# SortVisualizer

Simple project of visualizing sorting algorithms.
Made it on my free time. Absolutly not complete but it has a good shape for now.

## What sort are visualized
Currently Quicksort, Mergesort, Bubblesort, SelectionSort.
I want to add more.

## What next ?
- I want to add text under each sort to know its status and the sort being done.
- I want to improve the overall design.
- There is some stability issues, but I don't know from where there are coming, I don't really know how I should fix them.
- Adding more sorts.
- Adding more interactivity, like the numbers of elements getting sorted or the speed of sorting.

## SFML
Using SFML 2.5.1 (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/index.php).

Great first personnal project to start using SFML. Also a great comeback to C++.

## Issues
The project architectures is a bit messy. The project won't be clean without a complete refactor. But I don't want to redo all the project. It's not 100% stable but I find it fine for a first project. I've made some architecture mistakes but I've learn from it. Project should be thought a bit before jumping into coding.
